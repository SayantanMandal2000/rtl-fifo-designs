A synthesizable RTL design of a **Synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out)** buffer implemented in Verilog, supporting byte-wide data transfer with flow control (`full`, `empty` flags). Designed for FPGA/ASIC-ready environments where safe and ordered data buffering is critical.

## üîß RTL Design Block Diagram

The following block diagram represents the internal RTL structure of the synchronous FIFO design:

- **Write Path**:  
  The `wr_data` input is written into the memory block when `wr_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not full. A write pointer (`wr_ptr`) tracks the write address, incrementing on every valid write. The `full` flag is asserted when the write pointer is about to overlap the read pointer.

- **Read Path**:  
  Data is read from the memory and registered at the output `rd_data` when `rd_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty. A read pointer (`rd_ptr`) keeps track of the read location. The `empty` flag is asserted when both read and write pointers are equal.

- **Memory Block (`mem_reg`)**:  
  Acts as the storage element for the FIFO, implemented as a dual-port RAM that allows simultaneous read and write operations.

- **Pointer Logic**:  
  Separate binary counters for `wr_ptr` and `rd_ptr` manage read/write indexing. These are compared using combinational logic to generate `full` and `empty` flags based on pointer equality and offset conditions.

- **Registering Logic**:  
  Read data is registered at the output (`rd_data_reg`) to maintain stable timing and data integrity, aligning with synchronous design principles.

## üí° Description

This FIFO is implemented for **same-clock domain buffering**, useful for data queuing between two hardware blocks. When `wr_en` is asserted and FIFO is not full, data is written into memory. When `rd_en` is asserted and FIFO is not empty, data is read out.

The **write and read pointers** are updated using synchronous counters. The **full** condition is flagged when the write pointer is one step behind the read pointer (with wrap-around consideration). The **empty** condition is flagged when both pointers are equal.

## üìà Simulation Waveform

</p>

The waveform shows:
- FIFO correctly fills with data (`wr_data`) until `full = 1`
- Data is read sequentially from memory via `rd_data`
- `empty = 1` after all data is read

## üß™ Testbench

The testbench performs the following:
- Applies reset
- Writes 8 random data values into FIFO
- Reads back all values while observing status flags
- Verifies FIFO behavior under controlled conditions
