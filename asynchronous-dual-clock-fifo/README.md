A synthesizable RTL design of an **Asynchronous (Dual-Clock) FIFO** implemented in Verilog. This FIFO allows safe and reliable data transfer between **two independent clock domains**‚Äîwrite and read‚Äîusing pointer synchronization and Gray code logic. It's ideal for SoC designs, clock domain crossing (CDC), and multi-clock IP subsystems.

## üìå Key Features

- Fully synthesizable RTL design
- Separate read and write clocks (`w_clk`, `r_clk`)
- Safe pointer synchronization using Gray codes
- Dual-port memory implementation
- `full` and `empty` flag generation
- Overflow and underflow protection (via flag logic)
- CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) safety via 2-stage flip-flop sync
- Includes waveform and RTL architecture visualization
- Testbench-driven simulation in GTKWave

## üîß RTL Design Block Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the internal architecture of the asynchronous FIFO:

- **Write Path**:  
  Data is written into FIFO memory when `wr_rq` is asserted and the FIFO is not full. A **Gray-coded write pointer** is updated and synchronized into the read clock domain for `empty` detection.

- **Read Path**:  
  Data is read from memory when `rd_rq` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty. A **Gray-coded read pointer** is updated and synchronized into the write clock domain for `full` detection.

- **Memory Block**:  
  A dual-port RAM is used to store the data, with concurrent read/write access controlled by the respective clock domains.

- **Synchronization Modules**:  
  Two flip-flop-based synchronizers (`sync_w2r`, `sync_r2w`) handle the safe transfer of Gray-coded pointers across clock domains.

## üí° Theory

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Why Asynchronous FIFO?

In modern SoC and FPGA designs, it is common to have components operating on **different clock domains**. Direct data transfer across these domains can lead to **metastability** and **data corruption**. An **asynchronous FIFO** serves as a reliable buffer that uses **Gray code pointer synchronization** and **handshake-free control** to ensure **data integrity and timing safety** between these domains.

---

### üß† Key Concepts:

- **Gray Code Pointers**:  
  Used to reduce metastability issues during cross-domain pointer transfer (only one bit changes at a time).

- **Double Synchronization**:  
  Each pointer crossing into the opposite clock domain passes through **two flip-flops**, which minimizes metastability and setup/hold violations.

- **Full and Empty Logic**:  
  - `full` is raised when the next write would overwrite unread data.
  - `empty` is raised when no data is available to read.

## üìà Simulation Waveform

</p>

The waveform shows:
- Write operations filling the FIFO until `full = 1`
- Read operations consuming the data correctly
- `empty = 1` once all data is read out

## üß™ Testbench

The included testbench verifies:
- Proper reset behavior
- Full FIFO write and read cycles
- Flag transitions for `full` and `empty`
- Timing correctness between write and read domains
