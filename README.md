This repository contains Verilog-based RTL implementations of both **Synchronous** and **Asynchronous (Dual-Clock)** FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffers, widely used in digital systems for temporary data storage, clock domain crossing, and communication between different subsystems.

## üìò Description

üü¢ **Synchronous FIFO** ‚Äì Uses a single clock for both read and write operations.

üîµ **Asynchronous FIFO** ‚Äì Uses separate, independent clocks for write and read operations.

Both modules are essential components in digital design, especially in **System-on-Chip (SoC)** architectures where data needs to be buffered, streamed, or transferred safely across different modules or clock domains.

These FIFO designs include complete pointer management, flag generation (`full`, `empty`, `overflow`, `underflow`), and simulation testbenches with waveform outputs.

## üìñ Theory

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è What is a FIFO?

A FIFO (First-In First-Out) is a hardware buffer that stores data in the order it was written and ensures it is read out in the same sequence. It is widely used in scenarios like:

- Data streaming between producer and consumer
- Temporary data storage in pipelined systems
- Bridging between two clock domains (asynchronous FIFOs)

---

### üü¢ Synchronous FIFO

- Operates on a **single clock domain**.
- Uses binary counters for **read** and **write pointers**.
- `full` flag is raised when the write pointer catches up to the read pointer (with offset).
- `empty` flag is raised when both pointers are equal.
- Simpler and faster than asynchronous FIFO but limited to systems where both ends share the same clock.

---

### üîµ Asynchronous FIFO (Dual Clock)

- Operates on **two independent clocks** (`wr_clk` and `rd_clk`).
- Uses **Gray code** conversion for pointer synchronization across clock domains.
- Synchronizers (`sync_w2r`, `sync_r2w`) are used to safely pass pointers between domains.
- Handles clock domain crossing (CDC) using safe techniques to prevent metastability.
- More complex, but essential when interfacing modules running on different clocks.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Flag Logic

- `full` is asserted when the next write would overwrite unread data.
- `empty` is asserted when there is no data left to read.
- `overflow` and `underflow` are optional flags for debug or protection logic.
- Pointers are compared using binary or Gray-coded values depending on FIFO type.

---

These designs are built for clarity, modularity, and synthesis compatibility for FPGA/ASIC workflows.

## üìå Project Highlights

- ‚úÖ **Synchronous FIFO**
  - Single-clock domain read/write
  - Parameterizable data width and depth
  - Clean flag logic (`full`, `empty`)
  - Pipelined read/write pointers
  - Testbench and waveform simulation

- ‚úÖ **Asynchronous FIFO**
  - Dual-clock domain (independent write and read clocks)
  - Gray code pointer synchronization
  - `full`, `empty`, `overflow`, `underflow`, `valid` flag generation
  - Safe and robust cross-domain design
  - Integrated modules like `convert_b2g`, `convert_g2b`, and synchronizers

## üß™ Testbench Support

Both designs are fully testbench-driven.  
The testbenches include:
- Reset and initialization sequences
- Data push into FIFO (`wr_en`)
- Data read from FIFO (`rd_en`)
- Observation of status flags under different scenarios
